 * File contains action types definition. Action types are defined as string constants.
 * Action type names should be consistent and should reflect what is happenning when action with such type is triggered.
 *
 * _REQUEST suffix indicates that request is in progress. 
 * _REQUEST_SUCCESS suffix indicates that request succeeded.
 * _REQUEST_FAILURE suffix indicates that request failed. Additional action types could be defined if more fine-grained error handling is needed. 
 *
 * For more info on actions, action types and action creators

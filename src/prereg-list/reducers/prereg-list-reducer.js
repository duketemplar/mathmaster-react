/*
 * File contains Redux reducers for operating on the state related to the accounts component.
 * Actions describe the fact that something has changed in the application.
 * Reducers define how these changes should be affecting the state of the application.
 * Reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state: (previousState, action) => newState
 * Reducers should always either return new state, or return existing state by default.
 * Reducers should nerver modify its arguments or perform any of the side effects like API calls or routing transitions.
 *
 * See http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/basics/Reducers.html for more details on Reducers.
